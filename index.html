  <h3>BIO </h3>
      <p>
        MOZIAH (Marcus Moziah Guerrier) is a storyteller by trade. The 23-year-old Haitian-American creative from central New Jersey has been surrounded by artistic inspiration from an early age, and that energy went on to fuel his own pursuits as he grew into adulthood. After watching his dad sing around the house as a kid, Guerrier sang in church choirs, theater productions, attended Somerset County Vo-Tech’s Honors Theatre Arts Program and even played in a punk-ska band in high school.

        While attending NYU’s esteemed Tisch School of the Arts, he started to work under the name MOZIAH. With the help of his collaborators, MOZIAH wrote, co-produced, and released his first album Dax Nextdoor in 2018, which gained hundreds of thousands of streams across platforms and was a "coming of age story about fear, love, and learning to fuck with yourself." Along with the album, MOZIAH co-directed two music videos with his childhood friends, Cinematographer Nicolas J Capra and director Tyler Crosby:  “Can’t Stay In One Place” in 2018 and ”Skerred (feat. Still Gosling and AANI)“ in 2019. Last year, MOZIAH self-produced and released Finessa Hudgens which included collabs with CamRus (Camrus Johnson, CW’s Batwoman), Carter Ace, and mau.
